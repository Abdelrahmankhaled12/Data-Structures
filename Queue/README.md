# Queue

<ul>
    <li> The queue data structure is a sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of first in first out (FIFO). </li>
    <li> The first element inserted into the queue is first element to be removed. </li>
    <li> A queue of people. People enter the queue at one end (rear/tail) and leave the queue from the other end (front/head).</li>
    <li> Queue is an abstract data type. It is defined by its behavior rather than being a mathematical mode</li>
    <li>
     The Queue data structure supports two main operations 
     <ol>
        <li> Enqueue, Which adds an element to the rear/tail of the collection </li>
        <li> Dequeue, Which removes an element from the front/head of the collection </li>
     </li>
    
</ul>

## Queue Usage 

<ul>
    <li> Printers </li>
    <li> CPU task scheduling </li>
    <li> Callback queue in javaScript runtime </li>
</ul>



## Queue Implementation


<ul>
    <li> Enqueue(element) -> add an element to the queue </li>
    <li> Dequeue() -> remove the oldest element from the queue</li>
    <li> Peek() -> get the value of the element at the front of the queue without removing it</li>
    <li> isEmpty() -> check if the queue is empty </li>
    <li> size() -> get the number of elements in the queue</li>
    <li> print() -> visualize the elements in the queue</li>
</ul>
