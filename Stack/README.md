# Stack

<hr>

<ul>
    <li> The stack data structure iS a sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of last in first out (LIFO) </li>
    <li> The last element inserted into the stack is first element to be removed </li>
    <li> A stack of plates. The last plate placed on top of the stack is also the first plate removed from the stack </li>
    <li> Stack Is An Abstract Data Type. It Is DEfined By Its Behavior Rather Than Being a Mathematical Mode </li>
    <li>
     The Stack Data Structure Supports Two Main Operation 
     <ol>  
        <li> Push, Which Adds An Element To The Collection </li>
        <li> Pop, Which Removes The Most Recently Added Element From The Collection </li>
     </ol>
    </li> 
</ul>

## Stack Usage

<ul>
    <li> Browser History Tracking </li>
    <li> Undo Operation When Typing </li>
    <li> Expression Conversions </li>
    <li> Call Stack In JavaScript Runtime </li>
</ul>


## Stack Implementation


<ul>
    <li> Push(element) -> Add aN element to the top of the stack </li>
    <br>
    <li> Pop() -> Remove the top most element from the stack</li>
    <br>
    <li> Peek() -> Get the value of the top element without removing it</li>
    <li> isEmpty() -> Check if the stack is empty</li>
    <li> Size() -> Get the number of elements is the stack</li>
    <li> Print() -> Visualize the elements in the stack</li>
</ul>
