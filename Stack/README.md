# Stack

<hr>

<ul>
    <li> The Stack Data Structure IS A Sequential Collectio Of Elements That Follows The Principle Of Last In First Out (LIFO) </li>
    <li> The Last Element Inserted Into The Stack Is First Element To Be Removed </li>
    <li> A Stack Of Plates. The Last Plate Placed On Top Of The Stack Is Also The First Plate Removed From The Stack </li>
    <li> Stack Is An Abstract Data Type. It Is DEfined By Its Behavior Rather Than Being a Mathematical Mode </li>
    <li>
     The Stack Data Structure Supports Two Main Operation 
     <ol>  
        <li> Push, Which Adds An Element To The Collection </li>
        <li> Pop, Which Removes The Most Recently Added Element From The Collection </li>
     </ol>
    </li> 
</ul>

## Stack Usage

<ul>
    <li> Browser History Tracking </li>
    <li> Undo Operation When Typing </li>
    <li> Expression Conversions </li>
    <li> Call Stack In JavaScript Runtime </li>
</ul>


## Stack Implementation


<ul>
    <li> Push(element) -> Add AN Element To The Top Of The Stack </li>
    <li> Pop() -> REmove The Top Most Element From The Stack</li>
    <li> Peek() -> Get The Value Of The Top Element Without Removing It</li>
    <li> isEmpty() -> Check If The Stack Is Empty</li>
    <li> Size() -> Get The Number Of ELements Is The Stack</li>
    <li> Print() -> Visualize The Elements In The Stack</li>
</ul>
