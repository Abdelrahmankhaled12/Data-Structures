# Linked List

<ul>
    <li> A linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes
         Each node consists of a data value and a pointer that points to the next node</li>
    <li> The list elements can be easily inserted or removed without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure</li>
    <li> Random access of elements is not feasible and accessing an element has linear time complexity</li>
    <li>
     The linked list data structure supports three main operations
        <ol>
            <li> Insertion() -> to add an element at the beginning, end or at a given index in the list</li>
            <li> Deletion() -> to remove an item given its index or value</li>
            <li> Search() -> to find an element given its value</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ul>
